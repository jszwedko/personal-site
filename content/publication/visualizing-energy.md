Complex event detection over data streams has become ubiquitous through the
widespread use of sensors, wireless connectivity and the wide variety of
end-user mobile devices. Typically, event detection is carried out by a central
server executing continuous queries. In this demonstration, we focus on the
case where users with mobile devices submit continuous queries (for event
detection) to a data stream management server which disseminates the results to
the users over a shared broadcast medium. In order to minimize the overall
energy consumption of the mobile devices (clients), we have proposed operator
placement algorithms that split the processing of each continuous query between
the centralized server and the requesting mobile clients, thus trading off
energy consumption for communication energy consumption for computation.
Specifically, in this demonstration, we present an interactive graphical
interface to the inner workings of our three proposed operator placement
algorithms, whereby attendees are able to investigate various query plans and
the decisions that the algorithms make, as well as visualize the results of
these algorithms in terms of client power consumption and response time.
Besides being able to step through an algorithm's execution as it considers
various operator placement decisions, attendees are able to experiment with
different scenarios by customizing the parameters of the query workloads (e.g.,
changing the selectivities and projectivities of the operators) or the client's
profile (e.g., power consumed per unit of time of processing) and examine the
impact.
