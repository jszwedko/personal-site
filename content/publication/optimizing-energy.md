Complex event detection over data streams has become ubiquitous through the
widespread use of sensors, wireless connectivity and the wide variety of
end-user mobile devices. Typically, such event detection is carried out by
a data stream management system executing continuous queries (CQs), registered
by the users. In this paper, we consider the situation where the results of the
CQs, which are in the form of individual data streams, are disseminated to the
users' hand-held, battery-operated devices over a shared broadcast medium. In
order to reduce the overall energy consumption of the mobile devices, we
propose Bose*, a power-aware query operator placement algorithm that determines
which part of a CQ plan should be executed at the data stream management system
and which part should be executed at the mobile device. Bose*'s effectiveness
in reducing energy consumption, as well as response time under specific
conditions, is evaluated using simulation, driven by parameters measured on
real mobile devices.
