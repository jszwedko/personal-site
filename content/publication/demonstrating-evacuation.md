Casualties in emergency situations are often caused by panic and in cases where
building evacuation is required, they are often caused by a disorganized
evacuation. This has motivated us to design a two-layer indoor evacuation
system that takes advantage of two technologies all people carry on them,
namely, cellular phones with cameras and RFID cards. The proposed system
integrates QR-Code and RFID-based positioning with a routing system with
mounted terminals and displays for guiding people with RFID tags out of
a building. People with mobile devices with cameras use an application that
resolves QR-Codes into web addresses that point to dynamically generated
evacuation instructions. As a proof-of-concept, we have implemented this system
with commercially available tools and components as an e-scavenger hunt game
which uses SCAVY, our novel evacuation (routing) algorithm, to guide players
around a building visiting different locations in a load balancing manner. In
this demo, we are planning to deploy this e-scavenger game and the participants
would be able to follow the progress of the game (evacuation) through a system
monitor dashboard.
